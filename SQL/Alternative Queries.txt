1. Draw The Triangle 1

P(R) represents a pattern drawn by Julia in R rows. The following pattern represents P(5):

* * * * * 
* * * * 
* * * 
* * 
*
Write a query to print the pattern P(20).

SELECT REPEAT('* ', @NUMBER := @NUMBER - 1) 
FROM information_schema.tables, (SELECT @NUMBER:=21) t 
LIMIT 20


2. Draw The Triangle 2

P(R) represents a pattern drawn by Julia in R rows. The following pattern represents P(5):

* 
* * 
* * * 
* * * * 
* * * * *
Write a query to print the pattern P(20).

set @row := 0;
select repeat('* ', @row := @row + 1) 
from information_schema.tables 
where @row < 20


3. 
Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to 1000. Print your result on a single line, and use the ampersand () character as your separator (instead of a space).

For example, the output for all prime numbers <=10 would be:

2&3&5&7


SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(NUMB SEPARATOR '&')
FROM (
    SELECT @num:=@num+1 as NUMB FROM
    information_schema.tables t1,
    information_schema.tables t2,
    (SELECT @num:=1) tmp
) tempNum
WHERE NUMB<=1000 AND NOT EXISTS(
		SELECT * FROM (
			SELECT @nu:=@nu+1 as NUMA FROM
			    information_schema.tables t1,
			    information_schema.tables t2,
			    (SELECT @nu:=1) tmp1
			    LIMIT 1000
			) tatata
		WHERE FLOOR(NUMB/NUMA)=(NUMB/NUMA) AND NUMA<NUMB AND NUMA>1
	)
